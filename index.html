          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>World Medical Students was founded in 2018 in Dschang, Cameroon,
          central Africa as a non-profit association of medical professionals
          (students) and related fields. WMS has a double finality. Firstly, to optimize and facilitate the training of health professionals via the linking of the theoretical courses to practical situations ("knowledge and experience sharing" AND "learning by doing"). Secondly, to fight by all means for the progressive amelioration of the living conditions, and also the life expectancy of local and urban populations in Cameroon, Africa, and worldwide; putting products and services in concordance with our objective at their disposal. </p>

              <p>Medical professionals who plan to practice abroad face two highly significant challenges. Firstly, they need to provide international language certifications, such as IELTS Academic, OET, DELF, DALF, TELC, or Goethe. In addition, working in a foreign country requires a strong medical vocabulary.
                Advanced Language Education by Andreea Berkhout Academy provides you with skilled lecturers in more than 4 languages.
